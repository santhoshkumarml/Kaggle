Kaggle-Challenges
=================

Kaggle is a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions on which companies and researchers post their data and statisticians and data miners from all over the world compete to produce the best models. This crowdsourcing approach relies on the fact that there are countless strategies that can be applied to any predictive modelling task and it is impossible to know at the outset which technique or analyst will be most effective.

I am very interested in solving Real World problems using Data Sciene Algorithms. This is a Repository which contains my attempts to solve some of the Kaggle Challenges.
